At data.world, we’re committed to leveraging AI to build applications that drive productivity and enhance learning experiences across our organization. One recent example of this commitment is an app called **Owl Genius**. Developed as part of an initiative I led—the **AI Champions**—Owl Genius leverages AI to deliver highly personalized, targeted learning plans, tapping into the knowledge infrastructure we’ve built to support AI-powered learning.

#### The AI Champions: Learning and Building with AI

The AI Champions program brought together a cross-functional team from across data.world for a six-month term. The program’s focus was split 50/50: the first half on educating the team about the history, current state, and future of AI, and the second half on collaboratively applying these insights to a real-world project. Our collective project became Owl Genius—a custom learning tool designed to adapt dynamically to users’ needs, drawing from my prior work on the **Vectorizer** to enhance relevance and depth in the learning process.

#### Introducing Owl Genius: Personalized Learning for Our Team

Owl Genius is designed to offer customized, quiz-based learning plans that align with each user’s specific needs. Built with robust AI functionality, the app integrates OpenAI’s language models and our in-house **Vectorizer** middleware. Together, these technologies allow Owl Genius to draw from data.world’s vast resources, including documentation, tutorials, and other educational sites, to create a tailored, relevant experience for each learner.

#### How Owl Genius Works: A User’s Journey

1. **Exploring Areas of Learning**: Users can log in to access a variety of predefined learning areas. If their specific topic of interest isn’t listed, they can type it in to create a customized quiz. Here, the Vectorizer performs a vector search to match the query to relevant topics, ensuring that the quiz aligns with the user’s unique needs.


1. **Quiz and Feedback**: Users take a 10-question quiz on their chosen topic and receive immediate feedback on their responses. This feedback highlights areas for growth, with missed questions setting the foundation for a deeper, targeted learning plan.


1. **Generating a Learning Plan with AI and the Vectorizer**: Users can convert quiz results into a learning plan. Here, OpenAI’s language model creates follow-up questions, drawing on the missed areas to provide a structured learning path. Simultaneously, the Vectorizer middleware pulls relevant resources from across data.world’s properties, ensuring that each learning plan is populated with specific content tailored to the user’s needs. This seamless interaction between OpenAI and the Vectorizer enriches each learning plan with both specificity and contextual relevance, allowing users to dive deep into the most pertinent information.


1. **Tracking Progress**: Users can mark sections as complete, track progress within their learning plans, and view an overview of all their learning plans on their profile page, allowing them to monitor their growth over time.



#### For Admins: Streamlined Content Creation and Management

Owl Genius includes robust features for admins, enabling them to create, organize, and customize content efficiently:

- **Creating and Managing Areas of Development**: Admins can define broad or specific areas of development, enabling them to create targeted quizzes and corresponding learning plans for general topics or highly specialized knowledge areas.


- **Single Question Creation**: Admins can create custom questions with the help of AI, which generates multiple-choice options. They can then tag questions to specific learning areas, ensuring alignment with current training objectives.


- **Bulk Question Generation**: Admins can upload large text files to generate multiple questions at once, allowing for efficient content creation and scalability.



#### Fast, Efficient Development with AI

Owl Genius was developed in about a month, largely as a side project for the AI Champions team. This rapid development underscores the efficiency and potential of AI-powered tools in driving innovation. By combining OpenAI’s models with the Vectorizer middleware, we’re setting new standards in personalized learning experiences, enriched by data.world’s knowledge ecosystem.

#### The Power of AI in Learning and Development

Owl Genius is a shining example of how data.world is harnessing AI to transform learning and development. This app streamlines the learning process, giving users control over their growth while providing admins with tools to support organizational development. With Owl Genius, and thanks to the Vectorizer’s advanced knowledge retrieval capabilities, we’re paving the way for more impactful, AI-driven learning experiences that help our team members thrive.
