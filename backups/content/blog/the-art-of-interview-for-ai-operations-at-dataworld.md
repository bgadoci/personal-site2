In the rapidly evolving field of AI operations, the intersection of technology and business understanding is paramount. At data.world, we've adopted a unique approach to AI ops that emphasizes the importance of listening before building. This approach has been instrumental in our journey to integrate AI into our operations effectively.

### **Starting with a Conversation**

Our journey began in October last year when I initiated a series of interviews with departmental leaders. The goal was to gain a deep understanding of their workflows, challenges, and bottlenecks. These conversations were structured around four key areas:

**1 - Understanding the Organization and Structure**

We started by exploring the core functions and responsibilities of each department. Understanding their team structures and reporting hierarchies provided insights into how information flows within the organization. We delved into their key performance indicators (KPIs), current projects, and interdepartmental interactions. This foundational knowledge was crucial for identifying areas where AI could make a significant impact.

#### **2 - Identifying Operational Inefficiencies**

The next step was to uncover the time-consuming tasks and bottlenecks plaguing each team. By examining the tools and software currently in use, we could identify gaps in their capabilities. We sought to understand areas of resource underutilization and the biggest challenges faced by each department.

#### **3 - Exploring AI and Tech Opportunities**

We then explored the potential for AI and automation in each department. This involved discussing current uses of AI, if any, and identifying tasks ripe for automation. We probed into the possibility of using generative AI for content creation, data analysis, and other applications. 

#### **4- Future Objectives and Goals**

Understanding the short-term and long-term goals of each department helped us align AI solutions with their objectives. We discussed their vision for the next 1-3 years and upcoming projects of interest. This helped us identify the resources needed for them to achieve their goals more effectively.

### **From Insights to Action**

Following these interviews, our next step was brainstorming. We returned to the stakeholders with a list of AI-driven solutions and sought their input on which ideas could enhance productivity. After selecting the most promising ideas, we developed and refined these solutions, focusing on data sources, prompting, and external resources.

Testing these applications with stakeholders before a broader rollout was a critical step. We gathered initial feedback to make necessary adjustments and ensure the solutions were truly effective.

### **Measuring Success and Iterating**

Our approach includes conducting quarterly surveys to assess the effectiveness of our AI applications. We also use Mixpanel to gain a quantitative understanding of usage patterns. This combination of qualitative and quantitative feedback is vital for deciding whether to iterate on a project or discontinue it.

### **AI Ops: A Blend of Code and Constituents**

As we continue to integrate AI into our operations, it's important to remember that AI Ops is not just about coding and technology. It's equally about understanding and addressing the needs of the people and departments that make up our organization. By listening first and building second, we ensure that our AI solutions are not just technologically advanced but also deeply aligned with the unique challenges and objectives of each department at data.world.

The art of interview for AI Operations is a vital process that goes beyond mere technical prowess. It requires a keen understanding of business needs, a collaborative approach with stakeholders, and an iterative process that balances innovation with practicality. As we continue to evolve in this field, our commitment to this approach will be key in driving success and efficiency across the organization.
