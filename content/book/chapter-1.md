# Chapter 1: The Beginning

The morning sun crested over the mountains, casting long shadows across the valley. Sarah stood at the edge of the cliff, her eyes fixed on the horizon. Today was the day everything would change.

## The Journey Begins

"Are you sure about this?" Michael asked, his voice barely audible over the wind.

Sarah nodded without turning. "We've prepared for years. If we don't go now, we never will."

The path ahead was treacherous—both literally and figuratively. The ancient map they'd discovered in the university archives had led them here, to this remote corner of the world where legend and reality blurred together.

## The Discovery

Three months earlier, while cataloging forgotten texts in the basement of the university library, Sarah had stumbled upon a leather-bound journal dating back to the 1800s. Its pages contained detailed accounts of an expedition to find what the author called "the nexus point"—a place where, according to various mythologies across cultures, the veil between worlds was thinnest.

Most academics had dismissed the journal as fiction or the ramblings of a delusional explorer. But Sarah had recognized something in those yellowed pages: coordinates and landmarks that corresponded to real locations. Locations that, when mapped together, formed a pattern that couldn't be coincidental.

And now here they stood, at the first marker on their journey to find the truth.
