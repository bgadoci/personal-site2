# Acknowledgments

This book wouldn't exist without the support, insight, and encouragement of many individuals who have contributed in both direct and indirect ways.

First, I want to express my deepest gratitude to **Rachel Woods** [1]. Rachel started as an intern of mine but quickly became a leading voice in AI for the enterprise. She had the foresight to recognize the critical role AI would play in operations and, in a post shortly after ChatGPT hit the scene, coined the term AI Operations. That insight sparked my curiosity, and her influence has shaped the broader discussion around AI in the enterprise. Rachel's contributions to this space cannot be overstated, and her impact on this book is profound.

I'm also incredibly grateful to my longtime friend and co-founder of data.world, **Brett Hurt** [2]. Brett pushed me to write this book and encouraged me every step of the way. His passion for data, technology, and continuous learning has been a source of inspiration, and his belief in the importance of AI Operations helped give this book its foundation. Alongside him, **Matt Laessig** [3], COO of data.world and a great friend, played a key role in putting me in a position to take on this incredible job. His leadership, vision, and support have been invaluable in shaping my work in AI Ops.

A special thank you to **Bryon Jacob** [4], Co-founder and CTO of data.world, who is quite literally the reason I got to be in this position. Bryon listened to my wild ideas over beers and, instead of dismissing them, took it upon himself to actually create what I was envisioning. More than that, he has been there for every ridiculous technological question I've had along the way, always making time to help. His generosity with his time and deep technical expertise have made a lasting impact on my journey, and for that, I am endlessly grateful.

To the readers—whether you're a business leader, an AI practitioner, or someone simply curious about AI Operations—thank you for your time and engagement. I hope this book provides you with valuable insights, practical strategies, and a deeper understanding of how AI can enhance and transform operations in meaningful ways. The future of AI Ops depends not just on technology but on the people who implement, manage, and innovate within it.

Lastly, I want to thank my family and friends, who have supported me through the long hours of writing and research. Their patience, encouragement, and insightful feedback have been invaluable throughout this process. I am fortunate to have such a strong support system.

Thank you all for being part of this journey.
