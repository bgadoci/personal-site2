## Key Qualities for Building an AI Operations Team
Building an effective AI Operations (AI Ops) team requires a unique blend of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and adaptability. This team must bridge the gap between AI capabilities and business goals, ensuring AI initiatives are both impactful and sustainable. Remember from earlier in this book the concept that AI has been in the back office of companies and then suddenly post-2022 it's in the front office. The AI Operations team needs to be a business/operations-biased team, not just a technical one.

Team building for AI Operations is going to look different based on the stage of AI Operations ("Wow," Easy Scale & Education, or AI Ready Data) and also different based on the company/industry/etc. So let's start by taking a look at the types of qualities you will need on the team instead of the actual roles and headcount.

### STACK-B: The Core Qualities of an AI Ops Team
To structure these qualities, we introduce the **STACK-B** framework:

- **S – Systems Thinker:** Understands complex relationships and foresees cross-departmental impacts.  
- **T – Technologist:** Ability to develop, implement, and optimize AI solutions.  
- **A – Adaptable:** Thrives in a fast-changing AI landscape, adjusting strategies as needed.  
- **C – Communicative:** Bridges AI teams and business leaders, articulating AI concepts effectively.  
- **K – Knowledge-Seeker:** Constantly exploring new technologies, questioning assumptions, and testing solutions.  
- **B – Bold:** Willing to take risks, challenge conventional thinking, and push boundaries in AI problem-solving.

### Breaking Down the STACK-B Framework

#### Systems Thinker
At the core of a great AI Operations team is a systems thinker. In short, a systems thinker is someone who can see the whole, not just the parts. Systems thinking is **not** "systematic thinking" either. It's a way of solving problems and thinking that understands complex relationships. Your AI Operations team lead needs to approach challenges holistically, ensuring AI initiatives align with business goals without creating unintended negative impacts across departments.

#### Technologist
The nature of the AI Operations team and projects requires someone of a technical nature—a developer who can code and work with AI. In some cases, there will be multiple skill sets here—Infrastructure, DevOps, front-end, etc. It will differ for each company and each AI Operations stage, but there is no way of getting around needing someone with a technical skill set.

#### Adaptable
Being adaptable is highly important for AI Operations team members. Not just for the fast nature and context switching that will come with the role itself but to keep up with the broader AI landscape, which is evolving at a technological pace we haven't experienced before. It's not uncommon for some new capability, feature, or product to be released before a project is complete using a now outdated approach.

#### Communicative
Communicating well is essential for AI Operations. This is not just about being a good talker—it's about understanding the nuances of conversation, asking questions, guiding discussions, and digging deeper. The AI Ops team must work with multiple departments to understand their processes and collaborate effectively. Communication is equally critical for AI prompting, as generative AI thrives on structured and precise input. Effective communication builds trust, reduces fear of AI-related job displacement, and ensures project success.

#### Knowledge-Seeker
At its core, AI Operations is about solving problems, and that requires curiosity. Curiosity about how things work, possible solutions, and how those solutions perform. Whether during the interview process, development, or education stages, AI Ops team members need to be obsessed with acquiring and testing new information.

#### Bold
AI Operations teams need to be bold. They must be willing to take calculated risks, challenge established workflows, and experiment with new AI-driven solutions. Boldness fuels innovation, encouraging the team to push beyond conventional thinking and explore novel applications of AI that can drive business transformation.

### The Role of the Business/Department Expert
One other characteristic to consider is one that may or may not reside on an AI Operations team: the Business/Department Expert. This person deeply understands the purpose and operations of the team the AI Operations team is collaborating with. In some companies, it may make sense to have this as a full-time AI Operations team member, and in others, it may be a designated liaison. Regardless, having deep knowledge of the specific function is critical to successful AI Operations outcomes.

### Conclusion: STACK-B for AI Success
Building an AI Ops team isn't just about technical proficiency; it requires **STACK-B**—Systems Thinking, Technologist skills, Adaptability, Communication, Knowledge-Seeking, and Boldness. By ensuring your team embodies these characteristics, your organization will be well-equipped to drive AI initiatives that are innovative, practical, and impactful.

## Reporting Structure
One of the most crucial decisions in structuring an AI Operations (AI Ops) team is determining its reporting hierarchy. The placement of the AI Ops leader within an organization can significantly impact the team's effectiveness, strategic alignment, and ability to drive AI adoption across the enterprise. The reporting structure should ensure that AI Ops remains operationally relevant, aligns with business priorities, and has executive sponsorship for long-term success.

### Preferred Reporting Structures
The AI Ops team should ideally report to a senior executive who has both operational oversight and strategic influence. Below are the three primary reporting structures, along with their benefits and potential challenges:

1. **Reporting to the Chief Operating Officer (COO) (Recommended)**
   - **Benefits:**
     - Operational Focus: The COO oversees company-wide operations, making AI Ops a natural fit under this leadership.  
     - Broad Scope: AI Ops spans multiple departments (HR, finance, customer service, IT, etc.), and the COO is best positioned to ensure AI solutions align with overall business operations.  
     - Efficiency and Scalability: AI Ops can integrate directly into existing operational workflows, reducing silos and ensuring AI adoption at scale.  
     - Cross-Functional Impact: Since AI Ops influences multiple business areas, a COO-led structure allows for a seamless connection between departments.

   - **Potential Challenges:**
     - If the COO is unfamiliar with AI and technology trends, they may not fully leverage AI Ops' potential.  
     - May require additional technical oversight from a CTO or CIO to ensure AI models and infrastructure are implemented correctly.

2. **Reporting to the Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**
   - **Benefits:**
     - Technical Expertise: The CTO understands AI's technological complexities and can ensure its proper integration with IT infrastructure.  
     - Innovation Leadership: AI Ops will have direct access to R&D initiatives, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.  
     - Scalability: The CTO can oversee technical scaling and cloud-based AI implementations.

   - **Potential Challenges:**
     - AI Ops may become too focused on technology rather than business outcomes.  
     - Limited influence over operational and process-driven teams, making AI adoption in non-technical areas more challenging.

3. **Reporting to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)**
   - **Benefits:**
     - Top-Level Strategic Priority: AI Ops will be directly aligned with the company's overall vision and long-term strategy.  
     - Company-Wide AI Adoption: With CEO backing, AI Ops initiatives are more likely to receive funding and executive buy-in.  
     - Cross-Departmental Reach: Direct oversight from the CEO ensures AI Ops influences the entire organization.

   - **Potential Challenges:**
     - Bandwidth Issues: CEOs often lack the time to be directly involved in AI Ops, which can lead to bottlenecks in decision-making.  
     - Delegation Challenges: Without technical or operational expertise, AI Ops may require additional oversight from other C-suite members.

### Choosing the Right Reporting Structure
The best reporting structure depends on the company's size, AI maturity, and strategic priorities. However, in most cases, reporting to the COO provides the optimal balance between operational integration, cross-functional collaboration, and scalability. If the COO lacks AI expertise, a dual-reporting relationship to the CTO for technical oversight may be beneficial.

For highly technical companies where AI innovation is a core product, reporting to the CTO may be more effective. In AI-first organizations where executive-level prioritization is essential, reporting to the CEO could be considered, but only if the CEO is highly engaged in AI initiatives.

### Final Recommendation
For most organizations, AI Ops should report to the COO to maintain an operational focus, drive business impact, and scale AI adoption across the enterprise. However, a close partnership with the CTO ensures that AI Ops solutions are technologically sound and strategically implemented. Establishing regular executive check-ins with the CEO can also help align AI Ops with broader business objectives.
