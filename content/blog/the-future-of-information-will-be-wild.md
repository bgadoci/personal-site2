title: The future of information will be wild
---

The rise of AI has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake audio and video content. With the widespread availability of sophisticated editing tools and deepfake technology, it’s becoming harder to trust the authenticity of the content we see and hear. This is inevitably leading to a world where we can’t trust what we hear with our own ears and see with our own eyes. What is fact and what is fiction? As a result, the future of information sharing will depend on the trustworthiness of the source rather than the content itself.

In this new era of information overload, people will have to rely more on sources for their information. Despite his often controversial statements on Twitter and criticism of Twitter Blue, Elon Musk seems to be ahead of the curve here. Every person who was brave enough to change anything faced doubt. Elon has proved that he’s undeterred by this headwind. I hope others follow. The world will need to get back to a trusted source of truth.
