An update to let you know that version 2.0 of Fitpholio statistics is now live! After adding metrics to the home page, I found myself wanting more insights. So, I''ve implemented a quick and dirty solution.

You can now filter your fitness minutes and tests by different time periods to get averages. Additionally, you can see totals for all the fitness tests you''ve entered.

To make things easier, I''ve included a fast-follow feature on the post form from the profile page. This means that when you select a movement like Deadlift, you''ll only get a subset of options for your post. By directing users to more measurable metrics, we can help them achieve better results with their data.

I hope you like these new changes, and stay tuned for more updates to come!
