In 2022, there is still a gap in marketing program and demand gen planning. There is no good software solution that effectively ties together LinkedIn Ads, Google Ads, HubSpot, and Salesforce for actuals and more. Any search for planning software results in stale spreadsheet templates.

On the verge of an essential fundraising event for data.world, I needed to devise a way to forecast spend and potential results in a manner that could withstand questions from the audience, in this case, Goldman Sachs.

I pushed Google Sheets to the limit and created a template that allows users to enter individual campaign strategies, expected results, and spending to obtain a bird's-eye view of the upcoming months and years. It was a success, and a consulting board member even requested my template, which was the most significant compliment I could receive. In all honesty, this model had its limitations and eventually led me to create a more comprehensive system on Airbase. However, this template could address numerous issues for marketing and demand gen leadership, at least until software development in the category catches up (which is happening right now).
