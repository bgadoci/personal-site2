  Depth for data.world'
---

At data.world, we’re excited to announce the release of the Catalog & Cocktails Chat Experience, an innovative, mobile-friendly app that leverages our newly developed Knowledge API, part of the powerful Vectorizer-2 toolset. This new feature is designed to enhance the accuracy and depth of information our chatbot can provide, transforming how we manage and utilize content. Let’s dive into the technical details of this API and understand why it’s a game-changer for our AI operations.

### The Power Behind the Knowledge API

The Knowledge API is designed to supercharge our chatbot's ability to provide accurate and comprehensive responses. It achieves this by creating "knowledge chunks" from all the content available on our public-facing sites, including documentation, websites, and developer portals. Instead of merely summarizing content or averaging embeddings, the Knowledge API applies its own embeddings to much smaller chunks of content. This granular approach ensures that even the most nuanced concepts, which might be overlooked in a summary, are accessible to inform the chatbot's responses.

Additionally, the Knowledge API allows us to upload PDFs, such as the AI Benchmark Study or Juan’s book *Designing and Building Enterprise Knowledge Graphs*, and transform them into knowledge chunks. This means that even deeply technical documents or long-form reports that aren’t readily available on the web can now be used to inform our bot's answers, making it more versatile and accurate.

### How It Works

Here’s a visual representation of how the Knowledge API integrates into our system:

1. **User Message**: The process begins when a user sends a message.


1. **System Message Generation**: The system takes the user message and processes it to generate a system message that includes the original user message, related resources, a knowledge summary, and specific instructions.


1. **Vectorizer-2 Resource Search**: This component searches for relevant resources based on the user message.


1. **Vectorizer-2 Knowledge API**: Concurrently, the Knowledge API breaks down the content into smaller, manageable knowledge chunks, making detailed information easily accessible.


1. **OpenAI Integration**: The processed information is then sent to OpenAI, which helps generate a comprehensive bot response.



This integrated approach allows the bot to recommend content and answer questions more accurately by utilizing both the Vectorizer-2’s resource search and the newly implemented Knowledge API.

### Technical Deep Dive: Chunk Summary vs. Knowledge Summary

The Knowledge API provides flexibility in how it processes and summarizes content, allowing users to choose between two types of summaries: `chunk_summary` and `knowledge_summary`.

#### Chunk Summary

When the `chunk_summary` option is selected, the API returns a summary for each individual chunk of content. This summary is generated by OpenAI and includes additional details such as the URL (if available) and any names of people mentioned in the content. This detailed information enriches the system message, enabling the chatbot to provide highly specific and relevant responses.

Here’s a snippet.

Alternatively, the `knowledge_summary` option combines the content of multiple chunks into a single, comprehensive summary. This method allows the user to specify the number of chunks to include in the summary, making it adaptable to the scope of information needed. This aggregated approach helps create an informed system message, enhancing the bot's ability to provide thorough and contextually rich responses.

This process begins by analyzing the user’s input to determine the underlying intent behind the query, ensuring that the summary generated is not only comprehensive but also contextually relevant. By incorporating intent classification, the Knowledge API can tailor its responses to better address the specific needs and goals of the user, resulting in more accurate and meaningful interactions. This extra layer of understanding allows the system to generate a highly informed summary, enhancing the overall quality and precision of the information provided.

The introduction of the Knowledge API is a pivotal enhancement to our AI operations for several reasons:

1. **Enhanced Accuracy**: By breaking down content into smaller chunks, the Knowledge API ensures that even the most specific details are captured and made available for responses. This leads to more accurate and reliable information being provided by the chatbot.


1. **Broader Knowledge Base**: The ability to upload and process PDFs and other long-form documents means that our chatbot can draw from a much wider pool of information. This is particularly valuable for handling complex queries that require in-depth answers.


1. **Dynamic Updates**: The API allows for real-time updates and integration of new content, ensuring that the information used by our apps is always current. This reduces the need for manual updates and helps in maintaining the relevance and accuracy of the data.
