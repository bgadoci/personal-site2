title: The Incredible Journey of a Young Athlete and the Power of AI to help write
  training programs.

In a world where technology and human potential intersect, remarkable stories of determination and innovation often emerge. One such story is of my daughter, a 13-year-old athlete with aspirations that soar as high as her ambitions. Her journey towards aiming to compete in the CrossFit Games is a testament to her incredible work ethic and the supportive role technology can play in achieving one's dreams.

My daughter's daily routine is nothing short of extraordinary. Waking up before dawn at 4:45 am, she starts her day with a rigorous CrossFit session, followed by preparing her own breakfast and lunch, attending school, and excelling academically. Her afternoons are filled with cheerleading or soccer, and then it's back to the gym for another two hours of training. Her discipline extends to the kitchen, where she often cooks dinner for the family, before finally sitting down to her studies. Her dedication is truly inspiring.

To support her in her ambitious endeavor, I've tried to be by her side, participating in workouts whenever possible. However, recognizing the limits of my ability to keep up with her training volume, I sought other ways to assist her. This led me to sign her up for [CrossFit Mayhem's programming](https://www.mayhemathletes.com/?comet_source=google&comet_network=g&comet_campaign=19706433526&comet_ad_group=147290411258&comet_ad_id=648539020278&comet_keyword=crossfit%20mayhem&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzoeuBhDqARIsAMdH14Ga2Hvvu-sRLs5XGlzX6Mo7UGIuvomSrVKI6xvlFcvd7rNv0IFvxKQaAh0MEALw_wcB) and encourage her participation in a local CrossFit gym. As she delves deeper into the world of CrossFit, her curiosity about various training aspects grows. CrossFit's emphasis on diverse energy systems and a wide range of movements, from weightlifting and gymnastics to Olympic lifting, presents a complex landscape for any athlete, especially one as young and ambitious as my daughter.

> This AI-powered tool has revolutionized the way she approaches her training. 



However, her journey is not without its challenges. Being underage and unable to drive limits her access to the necessary training facilities and equipment at times. This often leads to a dilemma: how to adapt the day's programming to available resources without compromising on the training's effectiveness or risking overtraining. To address these concerns, I turned to an innovative solution: creating a custom GPT via Chat-GPT tailored specifically to her training needs.

This AI-powered tool has revolutionized the way she approaches her training. By inputting specific goals, current statistics, and a weekly training framework, the tool generates a personalized training plan that is both flexible and responsive to the equipment she has access to and the intended stimulus of each session. This means she now carries a virtual coach in her pocket, ready to adjust her training plan on the fly, ensuring she remains on track toward her goals.

The implementation of this AI solution is a vivid example of how technology can be harnessed to enhance personal growth and achievement. It not only addresses the logistical challenges faced by a young athlete but also empowers her to take control of her training in an informed and structured manner. The ability to customize her workouts based on specific inputs and change plans according to available resources is a game-changer, making the pursuit of her dreams more accessible than ever.

Here are some screenshots of the prompt and output but please know that the volume here is only possible because sheâ€™s been building up to this for 8 months. This is definitely not a program for 99% of the people out there. More, it was designed to give her a lot and she can pick and choose what she will do each day based on her location, recovery, and mental readiness. It tooks months of education and close parenting to make sure she is healthy mentally and physically to operate at this high level. More, this is being driven by her goals and desires and has nothing to do with us as parents intending or forcing her to do this. This is all her. She wants to be a champion and that goal requires a special level of commitment, understanding, and attention.
