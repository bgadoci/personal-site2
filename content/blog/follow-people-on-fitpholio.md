title: You Can Now Follow People on FitPholio
---

Sometimes, I question why I pour so much effort into, but I persist nonetheless. I think part of my motivation stems from the fact that its success or failure is completely up to me. I savor both the failures and small victories. On average, I acquire a new user each day. Unfortunately, most of them sign up, never post anything, and don''t return. It''s somewhat disheartening, but that''s not what it''s really about.

I personally find this site quite useful. It helps me understand my progress and identify areas where I need to concentrate my efforts. A friend of mine has been posting his workouts mostly to support me. I grew tired of repeatedly typing his username into the URL, so I created a feature to follow users. It''s a bit crude, but it functions effectively.

Currently, I''m following my son and daughter (I created their accounts) as well as my friend. Frankly, it''s not all that thrilling. However, I can''t shake the thought that there''s a group of people out there who would find FitPholio useful. Time will tell. In the end, it doesn''t really matter.

The learning experience right now is incredible and enjoyable. This endeavor has become my hobby, and I haven''t had something like this to occupy my time in quite a while.

As I move forward, I intend to continuously refine and develop FitPholio based on feedback and my own insights. Perhaps, soon, there will be more consistent engagement from users. Despite the challenges, I am excited about the future, and the possibility of creating a platform that not only I, but many others will find valuable. Here''s to more small wins and even the failures, for they are the stepping stones that pave the way towards success.
