We all know that hiring is important. We design job descriptions, interview questions, and final presentations because of this. Sometimes the need to get someone in the seat can cloud our decision-making process. We can't let that happen, and here's why.

#### A fit:

- Fits right in


- Onboards quickly


- Seeks information independently


- Is eager to get started


- Has a sense of ownership


- Asks for more responsibility


- Challenges the "why"


- Breaks things


- Fixes things


- Makes friends


- Takes initiative



#### A not-so-good fit:

- Onboards slowly


- Gets confused


- Defaults to inaction and seeks approval


- Asks for more information


- Wants more time


- Accepts the status quo and complains about why it sucks


- Is scared to break things


- Waits for instructions


- Tends to err towards inaction, creating doubt among co-workers



It's really hard to discern these nuances in a hiring process. I've been involved in designing a lot of them. Pay close attention to the new hire's behavior in the first month. If it's not trending in the right direction, give them specific feedback and up to three months to fix it. If you don't see improvement, pull the plug.

There is only one way to measure a new hire. They either meaningfully move your team forward in a short time or they don't. Another way to put that is they very quickly make your life easier or more complicated. You won't know everything when you send the offer letter, but be vigilant in those first few weeks regarding the above points.

It's never enjoyable to admit you were wrong about a hire, but it's even worse to hold on to hope. Find the right people and invest in them. Otherwise, admit your mistakes and help them move on to something better for both them and you.
