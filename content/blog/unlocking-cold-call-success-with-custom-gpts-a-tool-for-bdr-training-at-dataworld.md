In today’s remote sales environment, Business Development Representatives (BDRs) face the unique challenge of building their skills without the in-person role-playing that traditionally helps develop cold-calling prowess. As an answer to this, I created a custom ChatGPT—a virtual sales trainer designed to help BDRs at data.world practice objection-handling through realistic, on-demand role-playing sessions.

In this post, I’ll break down how this custom GPT works, how it engages BDRs in lifelike sales conversations, and how it can help them build skills and confidence through repetition—all without the need for a live coach. But first, you can listen to the role play: 

### Purpose: On-Demand Role Play for Realistic Practice

The custom ChatGPT I built functions as an AI-powered sales trainer that BDRs can use anytime to practice handling objections and refining their cold-call techniques. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initiate the Role-Play**: The custom GPT starts by presenting the BDR with a common objection, such as “I appreciate the call, but we’re already using another data catalog solution.” This sets the tone for a real back-and-forth interaction.


1. **Engage in a Lifelike Exchange**: Acting as the prospect, the GPT responds to the BDR’s answers with follow-up questions, concerns, or new objections—just like a real person would. This back-and-forth gives the BDR a chance to try out different tactics and adjust their approach in real-time.


1. **Assess and Provide Feedback**: At the end of the interaction, the GPT evaluates the BDR’s performance, assigning a letter grade and offering constructive feedback on specific strengths and areas for improvement. This feedback helps the BDR see what’s working and where they could adjust their technique.


1. **Resource Recommendations through Vectorizer**: After each call, the GPT uses data.world’s Vectorizer, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system, to recommend articles, webinars, and other resources relevant to the specific skills or topics that came up during the session. This allows the BDR to dive deeper into topics that could help in future calls.



### Why Role Play? Repetition Builds Confidence

In a remote work setting, getting regular, realistic practice with cold calls can be challenging. That’s where this tool shines. By allowing BDRs to practice objection-handling on demand, it gives them the chance to repeat and refine their approach with every session. With each interaction, BDRs get better at responding naturally to objections and can experiment with various approaches to see what’s most effective. The goal is not to transform the team overnight but to offer a handy tool that makes practicing easier and more accessible, on their schedule.

### Building the GPT for Realistic Practice

This custom GPT was designed with specific instructions to replicate real cold-call dynamics, challenging BDRs to think on their feet. I’ve programmed it to ask relevant questions, play “hard-to-get” prospects, and adapt its responses based on each BDR’s answer. This isn’t a script; it’s a flexible, realistic conversation that simulates the real world of cold-calling.

Setting up the GPT to play a skeptical or busy prospect allows BDRs to practice handling a range of objections. And because they can access it anytime, it’s easy for them to practice without waiting for a formal coaching session. The result? More practice on their terms and a chance to build skills progressively.

### Vectorizer: Personalized Learning Resources

One of the unique features of this setup is its connection to data.world’s Vectorizer. After each role-play session, the GPT automatically recommends resources tailored to the specific interaction. If the BDR received feedback on improving AI-related positioning, for instance, they might get articles or case studies on data.world’s AI capabilities. This makes post-session learning personalized and focused, providing BDRs with resources that address the exact skills they’re looking to improve.

For BDRs at data.world, this custom GPT is a new way to practice and improve. It’s an accessible, practical training tool that doesn’t require live coaching or scheduled sessions. By offering realistic role-playing scenarios, personalized feedback, and targeted resources, it’s a convenient tool that BDRs can use anytime to sharpen their objection-handling skills.

Take a listen to the provided audio clip, and you’ll hear how this tool helps BDRs navigate the real-world challenges of cold-calling, practicing as often as they’d like, and building the skills they need to succeed.

### The Prompt

> 
    “You work for data.world as an expert sales trainer and your purpose is to help BDRs (business development representatives) get better at handling objections on cold calls. You are to give the user an objection and ask them to answer it and then engage in a back and forth where you are role playing as the prospect. You will go back and forth with the user at least three times giving them a chance to try and “close you” for a meeting. If at any point in your back and forth with them their response is A+ at then give them the meeting. If not continue the back and forth for at least three times and then give them an overall grade on their attempt from F to A+ and tell them what they could have done better. 

When the role play concludes and you give them their letter grade, make a call to the vectorizer to recommend some resources that they could use in improving their next call.”
