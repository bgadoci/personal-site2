### Introduction

AI-driven coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and newer tools (e.g. Jolt AI) are increasingly being integrated into software engineering workflows. These AI tools can generate code, explain snippets, and even assist in debugging. Research and industry reports show both excitement and concern about their impact, especially in **large, established codebases**. This report surveys academic literature, industry discussions, and case studies to understand how such AI coding tools are being adopted, the key challenges that arise, and emerging solutions. We focus on enterprises and teams managing massive code repositories, where issues of code quality, knowledge retention, and workflow changes are especially pronounced.

### Overview of AI Coding Tools in Software Engineering

AI coding assistants have quickly moved from novelty to common practice in many development environments​ [cacm.acm.org](https://cacm.acm.org/research/measuring-github-copilots-impact-on-productivity/#:~:text=Code,spanning%20multiple%20lines%20at%20once) [dev.to](https://dev.to/maximsaplin/exploring-cody-an-ai-coding-assistant-that-knows-your-codebase-17bh#:~:text=While%20Copilot%20brought%20cautious%20interest,It%20was%20true%20magic). Early studies (and developers’ experiences) highlight improved productivity and satisfaction when using tools like Copilot​ [github.blog](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-in-the-enterprise-with-accenture/#:~:text=...%20github.blog%20%2090,coding%20more%20with%20Copilot%27s). For example, a recent enterprise deployment at ZoomInfo found that around 33% of AI suggestions were accepted, contributing hundreds of thousands of lines of code to their products​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=This%20paper%20presents%20a%20comprehensive,limitations%2C%20and%20lessons%20learned%20from) [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=generated%20code). Developers reported ~20% time savings with Copilot, feeling it helped them focus on higher-level work​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=Our%20developers%20primarily%20enjoy%20the,while%20vetting%20the%20generated%20code). Industry surveys also note that *“AI pair-programming tools such as GitHub Copilot have a big impact on developer productivity”* across skill levels​ [cacm.acm.org](https://cacm.acm.org/research/measuring-github-copilots-impact-on-productivity/#:~:text=Key%20Insights).

However, the literature and online discussions also point out *“hidden costs”* or downsides. Academic research warns about **quality and security issues** with generated code, noting that AI suggestions can contain bugs or vulnerabilities that require careful review​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=Code%20Quality%20and%20Vulnerabilities%3A%20The,thorough%20review%20before%20being%20integrated). Industry bloggers and engineers share anecdotes of AI-generated code that *“follows well-known patterns”* but struggles with novel or complex requirements​ [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137527#:~:text=,is%20now%20larger%20than%20ever). In other words, current AI excels at the “easy 70%” of coding tasks but often falters on the tricky 30% that make software production-ready [newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-will-change-software-engineering#:~:text=A%20tweet%20that%20recently%20caught,an%20exercise%20in%20diminishing%20returns) [newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-will-change-software-engineering#:~:text=What%20typically%20happens%20next%20follows,a%20predictable%20pattern). This has sparked debates in forums and articles, with some provocatively arguing that *“we’re trading long-term understanding for short-term productivity”* if developers rely too heavily on AI​ [nmn.gl](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20becoming%2010x%20dependent%20on,There%E2%80%99s%20a%20difference). The consensus in emerging literature is that AI coding tools are powerful but need to be integrated thoughtfully, especially for large-scale projects where mistakes amplify.

### Key Challenges of AI Integration in Large Codebases

Integrating AI coding assistants into teams with **legacy or extensive codebases** has surfaced several challenges in both research and practice. Notable issues include:

#### **Code Review Bottlenecks and Quality Control**

While AI can generate code quickly, reviewing that code becomes a new bottleneck. Human reviewers often must scrutinize AI contributions closely for errors, style mismatches, or security issues​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=Our%20developers%20primarily%20enjoy%20the,while%20vetting%20the%20generated%20code). A study at ZoomInfo noted that the *time saved* by Copilot was partly offset by *“additional scrutiny required while vetting the generated code”*​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=Our%20developers%20primarily%20enjoy%20the,while%20vetting%20the%20generated%20code) . In traditional settings, code reviews already take significant time – *around 18 hours on average per pull request* in one analysis​ [virtasant.com](https://www.virtasant.com/ai-today/how-an-ai-code-review-can-solve-inefficiencies-in-development#:~:text=engineers%20often%20juggle%20multiple%20tasks%2C,quality%20and%20prolonged%20review%20times). An influx of AI-generated changes can overwhelm these workflows, leading to backlogs. Moreover, inconsistent AI output means reviewers might catch some issues and miss others, potentially lowering overall code quality. Without adjustments, teams risk a scenario where AI speeds up coding only to shift the slow-down to the review phase. This has motivated interest in AI-assisted code review tools (discussed later) to alleviate the load.

#### **Loss of Institutional Knowledge and Skill Erosion**

Veteran engineers warn that over-reliance on AI assistants could erode hard-won knowledge and skills. One developer described a gradual “decay” in their abilities: *“I stopped reading documentation…my debugging skills took a hit…Previously, every error taught me something. Now the solution appears magically, and I learn nothing.”*​ [nmn.gl](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers#:~:text=It%20crept%20up%20on%20me,subtly). By outsourcing thinking to an AI, newer team members might never gain deep understanding of the codebase. Important institutional knowledge – the reasons behind certain architectures or the nuances of a legacy system – may be glossed over by AI’s generic answers. As a result, organizations fear a *“generation of developers who can ask AI the right questions but can’t understand the answers”*, left *“increasingly helpless”* when the AI is unavailable​ [nmn.gl](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers#:~:text=Right%20now%2C%20somewhere%2C%20a%20new,with%20a%20bug%20for%20hours). In short, if engineers become passive “copilots” to the AI, the organization’s collective expertise can atrophy. Maintaining a balance between using AI and ensuring humans still **learn the codebase’s ins and outs** is a crucial challenge.

#### **Increased Technical Debt and Legacy System Friction**

Unrestrained use of AI-generated code can introduce **technical debt** — quick solutions today that create maintenance burdens tomorrow. AI models are trained on common coding practices and may not grasp a company’s specific architectural patterns or constraints​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=Our%20developers%20primarily%20enjoy%20the,while%20vetting%20the%20generated%20code). This can lead to suggestions that “work in the moment” but violate project conventions or add complexity. As one analysis put it, *“They work best where we need them least”* – straightforward tasks – but *“royally screw up the hard stuff”* unique to a complex system [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137527#:~:text=good%20advice%20only%20to%20the,makes%20your%20job%20considerably%20harder). Developers on Reddit observed that AI code generation *“works well for small stuff, but not [for] organization in huge codebases,”* often resulting in a poorly organized high-level structure if used naively​ [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ffpuwm/does_ai_generated_code_create_technical_debt/#:~:text=this%20is%20the%20wrong%20framing,end%20up%20with%20tech%20debt). Without human guidance, an AI might duplicate functionality that already exists or introduce subtle bugs, increasing the future workload (i.e. debt).

Legacy codebases pose a particular problem. Companies with older, “gnarly” code have found that current AI tools struggle to navigate their unconventional or outdated patterns​ [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42137527#:~:text=,is%20now%20larger%20than%20ever). In fact, *“companies with relatively young, high-quality codebases benefit the most from generative AI tools, while companies with gnarly, legacy codebases will struggle… the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.”*​ [bsky.app](https://bsky.app/profile/mattpocock.com/post/3lawkejq66c25#:~:text=did%3Aplc%3Aoeio7zuhrsvmlyhia7e44nk6). In other words, technical debt begets more difficulty when adopting AI, creating a vicious cycle. If the AI produces suboptimal code that isn’t carefully refactored, it adds to the debt — which then makes the AI even less effective. This challenge has made some engineers skeptical about using AI for mission-critical or large-scale code without robust oversight: *“the technology is not mature enough for enterprise-grade product teams, but extremely beneficial for startups where [the] codebase is more disposable.”*​[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ffpuwm/does_ai_generated_code_create_technical_debt/#:~:text=As%20per%20my%20experience%20with,it%20does%2C%20and%20at%20scale). Established companies must therefore guard against AI inadvertently accelerating the accumulation of technical debt.

### Shifting Roles and Responsibilities of Engineers

The advent of AI coding assistants is **reshaping the engineer’s role**. Rather than spending time on boilerplate or routine coding, developers are finding themselves in more of a supervisory and integrative position. A popular analogy is that today’s AI is like *“a very eager junior developer”* – able to generate code quickly but requiring *“constant supervision and correction”* [newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-will-change-software-engineering#:~:text=The%20reality%20is%20that%20AI,better%20you%20can%20guide%20them). This means senior engineers are acting as mentors or editors to an AI “teammate,” focusing on reviewing AI output, guiding it with better prompts, and integrating suggestions into the broader system. Junior developers, on the other hand, face a paradox: the AI can produce code beyond their experience level, but without enough knowledge they may not realize when it’s wrong. They might “accept incorrect or outdated solutions” and “struggle to debug AI-generated code” if left unchecked [newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-will-change-software-engineering#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20juniors%20often%3A). This shifts the learning curve – novices must be trained not only in programming, but in how to effectively use (and doubt) AI assistance.

Engineering managers and team leads also see their roles evolving. More effort goes into defining guidelines for AI usage (e.g. when to trust it, when to double-check) and ensuring knowledge transfer despite the AI’s presence. Some fear that if people become **prompt operators** rather than problem-solvers, creativity and deep system thinking will diminish​. Others note that AI can free up time for design, testing, and innovative work – if managed properly. In any case, integrating AI requires reexamining job roles: code writing might become a smaller part of a developer’s day, while activities like code reviewing, architectural decision-making, and maintaining AI models or prompts take on a bigger share. The entire software development lifecycle is being recalibrated around these tools.

### Case Studies and Insights from Industry

Real-world experiences from companies with large-scale projects provide insight into how AI coding tools are being handled:

- **ZoomInfo’s Copilot Deployment:** As mentioned, ZoomInfo (with ~400 developers and thousands of repositories) conducted a structured rollout of GitHub Copilot​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=This%20paper%20presents%20a%20comprehensive,limitations%2C%20and%20lessons%20learned%20from). They reported substantial adoption and developer satisfaction, but also highlighted limitations: Copilot lacked *“domain-specific logic”* understanding and showed *“lack of consistency in code quality,”* which meant engineers had to carefully review its output​[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=Our%20developers%20primarily%20enjoy%20the,while%20vetting%20the%20generated%20code). The company still found a net productivity gain, but their case study emphasizes the need for **training developers** on how to use the AI effectively and establishing review processes to catch mistakes ​[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=Our%20developers%20primarily%20enjoy%20the,while%20vetting%20the%20generated%20code). This indicates large organizations can benefit from AI assistants, but only with guardrails (e.g. iterative trials, monitoring acceptance rates, collecting feedback) in place.


- **Tech Giants (Microsoft, Google, Amazon):** Major tech firms are both providers and consumers of AI coding technology. Microsoft has aggressively integrated AI into its development ecosystem (GitHub Copilot, Copilot Chat, etc.) and presumably uses these tools internally – though specific internal results are not public, Microsoft’s endorsement itself signals their perceived value. Google, reportedly, has its own AI coding efforts (such as **AlphaCode** and code generation capabilities in its Bard and Gemini models). It was reported that Google even hired hundreds of developers to improve its code LLMs, after seeing OpenAI’s success, because *“coding accuracy is the key to unlocking new levels of AI performance”* [virtasant.com](https://www.virtasant.com/ai-today/how-an-ai-code-review-can-solve-inefficiencies-in-development#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20OpenAI%20and,for%20six%20months%2C%20mirroring%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s). Amazon took a slightly different route by creating **CodeWhisperer**, trained on open-source and AWS code, to avoid legal/IP issues Copilot faced. Amazon’s concern (shared by many firms) was that tools like Copilot might inadvertently produce copyrighted snippets from training data. By building an in-house solution, they aimed to control training data and provide enterprise features like code scanning for secrets. These tech companies illustrate a spectrum of responses: *build your own AI, integrate third-party AI under policies, or at minimum closely evaluate the tools’ outputs*.


- **Companies Limiting AI Usage:** On the flip side, some organizations have reacted cautiously due to confidentiality and security. For example, in 2023 Apple reportedly **banned** employees from using ChatGPT and Copilot at work over fears that sensitive source code or data could leak into AI training sets​ [ciodive.com](https://www.ciodive.com/news/apple-chatgpt-openai-copilot-generative-AI/650816/#:~:text=,limited%20ChatGPT%20use%20for%20workers). Samsung had a well-publicized incident where engineers input proprietary code into ChatGPT (which logs prompts for model training), leading the company to restrict AI chatbot use​ [ciodive.com](https://www.ciodive.com/news/apple-chatgpt-openai-copilot-generative-AI/650816/#:~:text=,limited%20ChatGPT%20use%20for%20workers). Big banks like JPMorgan have similarly blocked internal access to public AI services​ [ciodive.com](https://www.ciodive.com/news/apple-chatgpt-openai-copilot-generative-AI/650816/#:~:text=,limited%20ChatGPT%20use%20for%20workers). These cases underscore that industries with strict compliance (finance, hardware, etc.) are wary of AI tools unless they can be hosted privately or guaranteed not to retain data. Data privacy is thus a major adoption hurdle: *“Concerns over data privacy represent a key   stumbling block for enterprise plans to adopt generative AI”*​ [ciodive.com](https://www.ciodive.com/news/apple-chatgpt-openai-copilot-generative-AI/650816/#:~:text=Concerns%20over%20data%20privacy%20represent,quality%20outputs%20require%20detailed%20prompts). In response, vendors now offer **on-premises** or **privacy-centric** versions (for instance, OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise with no data retention, or Azure OpenAI where the model can run within a company’s cloud instance).


- **Domain-Specific Experiences:** Different sectors report unique challenges. For instance, some insurance and healthcare software teams note that AI code suggestions often lack awareness of regulatory requirements (like HIPAA compliance or audit logging), so they cannot blindly accept AI-written code. In high-performance computing or embedded systems (e.g. automotive firmware), engineers found that AI helpers trained mostly on web/cloud development examples are less useful, as they suggest inappropriate patterns or don’t understand real-time constraints. On the other hand, startups and smaller companies frequently mention that AI assistants serve as a force-multiplier for small teams, allowing junior devs to produce acceptable code with minimal mentorship – a trade-off that established companies might not risk, but a startup might accept to move fast.



These case studies illustrate that large codebases *can* leverage AI coding tools, but success requires attention to context, security, and developer education. Many firms are in experimental stages – running pilots, gathering metrics, and deciding how (or if) to roll these tools out more broadly.

### Emerging Solutions and Best Practices

The fast-evolving landscape of AI-for-code has prompted a range of solutions aimed at mitigating challenges and making the most of these tools. Emerging approaches include:

#### AI-Powered Code Review and Quality Assistance

To prevent code review from becoming a bottleneck, new **AI code reviewer** tools have been introduced. These systems use AI to automatically inspect code changes for bugs, style issues, or potential improvements. For example, Amazon’s **CodeGuru** and Meta’s internal tools scan pull requests with machine learning models to catch common problems. GitHub has previewed a “Copilot for PRs” that can summarize changes and suggest improvements. Early results are promising: AI can generate review comments in seconds, whereas human code reviews average nearly a day in turnaround​ [virtasant.com](https://www.virtasant.com/ai-today/how-an-ai-code-review-can-solve-inefficiencies-in-development#:~:text=%2A%20,quality%20feedback) [virtasant.com](https://www.virtasant.com/ai-today/how-an-ai-code-review-can-solve-inefficiencies-in-development#:~:text=Traditional%20code%20review%20processes%20are,quality%20and%20prolonged%20review%20times). Such tools aim to **standardize review quality** (reducing variance between strict vs lenient human reviewers) and offload the tedious parts of code inspection. However, they are typically used to assist, not replace, human judgement. Best practice is to let AI reviewers flag obvious issues (e.g. a null check missing, or a known insecure function usage), so human reviewers can focus on design and complex logic. In essence, AI is being deployed as a “second set of eyes” to accelerate code reviews and maintain quality as code volume increases.

#### Context-Aware AI Models for Large Codebases

A major limitation of current mainstream models is their limited window of context – they often only “see” the code in your current file or snippet. This is inadequate for large codebases where relevant information might be spread across many modules. To address this, context-aware AI coding assistants have emerged. **Jolt AI**, for instance, is explicitly designed for 100K+ line repositories and *“accurately selects context files on multi-million line codebases,”* automatically including relevant portions of the codebase when generating answers or code​ [usejolt.ai](https://www.usejolt.ai/#:~:text=,million%20line%20codebases). Sourcegraph’s **Cody** goes further by integrating with a code graph/index; it *“writes code and answers questions for you by reading your entire codebase,”* essentially having an internal knowledge of the project’s APIs and patterns​ [dev.to](https://dev.to/maximsaplin/exploring-cody-an-ai-coding-assistant-that-knows-your-codebase-17bh#:~:text=,something%20based%20on%20prior%20knowledge). These tools use techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): they search the codebase for pertinent snippets and feed those into the AI’s prompt. By being *codebase-aware*, they provide far more relevant suggestions (e.g., using internal utility functions instead of generic ones) and can even explain or navigate code on demand. This is especially valuable for onboarding new developers – instead of digging through outdated documentation, they can ask the AI questions about the code and get answers sourced from the code itself. Context-aware models greatly reduce the friction of AI in large projects, and feedback from teams using them is positive. In one testimonial, a CTO of a company with a 10+ year-old codebase said *“Jolt is the only AI tool that’s effective on our 10+ year old codebase. Its answers and code are spot on.”*​ [usejolt.ai](https://www.usejolt.ai/#:~:text=Jolt%20is%20the%20only%20AI,and%20code%20are%20spot%20on). While these advanced assistants are relatively new, they represent a key direction in making AI truly *integrate* with established codebases rather than exist on the periphery.

#### AI-Augmented Learning and Documentation

To counteract the potential loss of institutional knowledge, companies are turning AI into an ally for **developer education and knowledge capture**. One approach is using AI to generate documentation, comments, and even diagrams for existing code – essentially having the AI act as a documentarian. This can help preserve knowledge about tricky parts of the system in written form. Another approach is interactive learning: developers can ask AI bots (trained on the company’s code and internal wiki) questions about why code is written a certain way or how to use a particular library. For example, an engineer at a firm might query an AI assistant, “Explain the purpose of Module X and how it interacts with service Y,” and get an answer drawn from design docs and code – something that would otherwise require hunting down a veteran developer. Firms like IBM have explored AI “knowledge assistants” that capture tribal knowledge and make it queryable for employees​ [ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-code-generation#:~:text=helps%20streamline%20the%20software%20development,process).

On an individual level, there’s a growing recognition that AI can be a powerful **learning tool** if used with discipline. Experts recommend using AI to *augment* one’s understanding, not replace it: *“use AI to accelerate learning, not replace it entirely,”* as one technologist put it​ [newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-will-change-software-engineering#:~:text=robust%2C%20still%20requires%20real%20engineering,knowledge). Concretely, this means developers are encouraged to treat AI suggestions as opportunities to learn (“*why* did it suggest this approach?”) and to occasionally code *without* AI to practice their skills. Some companies have instituted “no-AI Fridays” or similar, to ensure juniors still learn to solve problems manually. In summary, rather than allowing AI to become a crutch that drains knowledge, forward-looking teams use it as a teacher and documentation generator – preserving and spreading institutional knowledge more effectively.

#### Smarter AI Role Assignment and Workflows

As organizations gain experience with AI tools, they are devising smarter workflows that assign the right tasks to AI versus human engineers. One emerging idea is to use **multiple AI agents in different roles**: for example, one AI generates code for a feature, and a second AI (with a specialization in testing or security) reviews that code or writes unit tests for it. This “AI pair programming” concept leverages the fact that different models (or model prompts) can be tuned for different objectives. While still experimental, such setups have shown that an AI acting as a reviewer can catch certain mistakes made by an AI coder, much like a human reviewer would – thereby improving the overall result before a human ever sees it. Researchers are actively exploring agent frameworks where one AI can call on another (e.g., an AI that knows it should ask a separate “code linter” AI to verify style or a “performance guru” AI to suggest optimizations). In practice, this could mean in a pull request, an AI automatically includes a report: “I wrote this code, and I also asked an AI code auditor to check it – here are the issues it found and improvements it made.” This layered approach is aimed at increasing trust in AI output and minimizing human correction effort.

Even without multiple AIs, teams are learning to delegate tasks selectively. **Boilerplate and repetitive code** (getters/setters, simple CRUD endpoints, config files) are now often left to AI, since the cost of a mistake is low and it saves valuable time. **Critical algorithms or complex refactoring**, in contrast, might be done manually or with very close human-AI collaboration (stepping through each suggestion). Some organizations have created internal guidelines on which categories of work are “AI-friendly” vs “human-only.” Moreover, the integration of AI is prompting better *specification* practices – writing clear requirements and test cases – so that whether code is written by human or AI, it meets the criteria. Engineers joke that we are becoming “prompt engineers,” but there is truth to it: crafting a good prompt or task description for the AI has become a skill, akin to writing a good design spec. The **roles within software teams are shifting** such that using AI effectively is a part of the job description.

### Conclusion

The integration of AI coding tools into large, established codebases is well underway, bringing both transformative potential and significant challenges. Academic studies and industry experiences concur that these tools can boost productivity, improve developer satisfaction, and even reduce certain types of errors – *if* used properly​ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13282v1#:~:text=Despite%20these%20limitations%2C%20we%20believe,1000s%20of%20lines%20of%20code) [cacm.acm.org](https://cacm.acm.org/research/measuring-github-copilots-impact-on-productivity/#:~:text=Key%20Insights). Companies managing massive software projects have seen success by rolling out AI assistants gradually, measuring their impact, and establishing best practices for their use. At the same time, key challenges around code quality, knowledge retention, technical debt, and team dynamics have become apparent. Without mitigation, issues like review bottlenecks or skill atrophy can erode the gains from AI.

Fortunately, the ecosystem is responding with innovative solutions. AI-assisted code review and testing promise to catch flaws introduced by AI at scale, while context-aware models are overcoming the context limitation to truly understand large codebases​ [dev.to](https://dev.to/maximsaplin/exploring-cody-an-ai-coding-assistant-that-knows-your-codebase-17bh#:~:text=,something%20based%20on%20prior%20knowledge) [usejolt.ai](https://www.usejolt.ai/#:~:text=,million%20line%20codebases). Companies are also learning to **adapt culturally** – treating AI as a collaborator that needs mentoring (and sometimes reining in), and investing in their developers’ growth alongside AI. Different industries are proceeding at different paces: tech-forward firms are embedding AI at the core of development, while others take a cautious, security-conscious approach, or choose bespoke in-house AI solutions.

In summary, the role of AI in software engineering is expanding, but it is doing so in a way that reinforces the importance of human judgement and institutional processes. As one engineer noted, *“Every time we let AI solve a problem we could’ve solved ourselves, we’re optimizing for today’s commit at the cost of tomorrow’s ability”*​ [nmn.gl](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20becoming%2010x%20dependent%20on,There%E2%80%99s%20a%20difference). The goal, then, for large organizations is to find the sweet spot where AI optimizes today’s work **and** improves tomorrow’s capabilities. By addressing the challenges and leveraging emerging tools, companies can integrate AI coding assistants to speed up development, while still safeguarding code quality and collective knowledge for the long run.
