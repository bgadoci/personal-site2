As I've mentioned in my previous posts, working with GPT has allowed me to not only create this site but also explore what creating a database-backed site might look like on my own. Combining React and Strapi has enabled me to make quick progress. The inspiration for this new site was based on the fitness logging and metrics features of my personal site and yesterday I shared a few screenshots of my local build without any CSS styles. I've learned that I would rather get the thing working first before messing with padding, line-height, and fonts, as much as I enjoy spending my time there.

Tonight, I stumbled upon a possible project name: Fitpholio. Initially, I wanted to name it Fitstack as a nod to [WODstack](https://bgadoci.com/post/wodstack), but it was already taken by a similar effort that could cause confusion in the eyes of the consumer, which, as someone who has named a product before, I know is important to the lawyers. I really wanted Fit or Fitness to be included in the name, but it was challenging to come up with a suitable option. After using GPT-3.5, I found Fitfolio, but it was taken (but unused), so I went with an alternative spelling. Here's what GPT had to say when I asked for its opinion on the name:

So there you have it. The working name is Fitpholio. Today, I made significant progress with adding workouts, tests, sun exposure, cold exposure, and sauna features. I also managed to introduce infinite scroll. Tonight, I'm starting the process of deployment configuration. I have a long way to go, but two nights ago, I made zero progress, and today things just sort of worked. Who knows if I'll have the time or expertise to take this any further but for tonight it's a win!

Here are some screenshots of the profile page again without any styles.
