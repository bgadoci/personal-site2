title: 'The Adolescence of Adulthood: A Midlife Perspective'
---

Remember those weird, crazy days of adolescence? Of course you do. It's that unforgettable time between childhood and adulthood, where your body is doing all sorts of weird things, hormones are raging, and you're trying to figure out who you are.

Well, guess what? I'm 45, and it feels like I'm back there again. The body's acting strange, hormones are changing, and I'm questioning things like never before. So, let's dive into this wild ride and explore why 40-50 years old is really more of an "adolescence of adulthood" rather than the dreaded "mid-life crisis."

### Adolescence & Adulthood: Two Peas in a Pod?

First things first: Adolescence is a tough phase. Physically, emotionally, everything's in turmoil. But hey, it gets better, right? We adults tell our teens to hang in there; it's all part of growing up.

Well, 40-50 years old isn't that different. My body's acting up, and I'm feeling a tad less sure of myself. It's more of a natural process than those clichÃ©d stories about buying a fancy car or finding a new partner. It's like adolescence, but for adults.

For some context, check out the book "The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50" by Jonathan Rauch. Here's the gist:

> Happiness dips in midlife, then rises again. This U-shaped curve is a normal part of aging, not a failure or crisis. It's all about understanding and embracing this pattern.



### Life's Happiness Curve: A Stage by Stage Guide

As a kid, everything is awesome! But then comes school, social pressures, and adolescence. It's still good, but not as shiny.

#### Age 20-40: Mission Mode

Here, we've got a mission. It's all about goals and direction. I want to be this, I want to do that, I want to have, see, get...you get the idea.

#### Age 40-50: Oh Snap!

Then there's this snag. Bodies not cooperating, parents aging, kids growing up, work plateauing. It's a jolt, but is it a crisis? Nah, it's just the adolescence of adulthood.

#### Age 50-70: New Wires, New Joys

According to Rauch, we get rewired here. Less about us, more about others. Service, simple joys, appreciation. It's a beautiful shift.

#### Age 70-90: Grateful Days 

And then we reach a phase where we're just happy to be doing anything. Gratitude reigns.

### Not a Crisis, but a Process

More and more, I see this transition as inevitable. It's not a crisis; it's a part of the journey. Recognizing it as normal might just help us avoid any real "crisis."

So next time someone mentions the "mid-life crisis," maybe just smile and think, "Nah, it's just the adolescence of adulthood." And as always, trust the process. It's all part of the plan.
