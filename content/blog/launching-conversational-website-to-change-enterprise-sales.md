  Website'

Not long ago, I had an idea that I couldn't shake. It was one of those lightbulb moments that I just had to share. So, I sat down with Bryon Jacob, a data.world co-founder and our CTO, to hash it out. By the end of our conversation I felt I did a good job communicating my idea and was happy that he was engaged. I didn’t expect what was next. 

About noon of the following day I got a simple slack message from Bryon that contained a link. The That's right, he had built an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) overnight. When I saw what he'd created, I was stunned. It was my original concept but elevated, infused with elements and features I hadn't even considered. Spectacular? You bet.

So, what was this mind-blowing creation? Let me introduce you to our Conversational Website (for now go to our [home page](https://data.world/home) and find the link to interact with us via generative AI so that we don’t get a bunch of bot spam to the actual URL), a game-changer aimed at revolutionizing how we, at data.world, engage with potential clients. Initially, we imagined it as a tool to fast-track the onboarding of our internal teams. You see, like any tech company in the complex space of data management, we have an extensive library of content that everyone—from sales to customer success—needs to grasp.

Here’s where our Conversational Website steps in. It's not just an FAQ bot; it's so much more. Using AI algorithms and company objectives to guide it, the tool sifts through our extensive content library to offer tailored advice and solutions based on individual user queries. It's your personal concierge through the often overwhelming world of our solutions. The best part? It paves the way for seamless, unforced interactions with our human sales team, only when the user is ready for that next step. Maybe for the first time ever it puts buyer and seller on the same team.

But wait, there's more. Under the hood, this AI isn't just facilitating user engagement. It’s analyzing it. Summarizing transcripts, gauging user sentiment, and even identifying intent. This intelligence surfaces to our inside sales team, giving them warm leads, essentially ready for conversion. The leads we surface are only those willing to be contacted. No more forms or downloading a report only to get 20 emails from a sales rep. 

This groundbreaking initiative caught the attention of Brett Hurt, our CEO, during an internal hackathon. He saw its potential immediately. True to his go-getter nature, he wanted it live, and he wanted it ASAP—within a week to be precise.

So, the team kicked into high gear. We iterated, refined, and launched the final product that promises to be the future of enterprise sales. It’s not just about streamlining operations; it’s about transforming the fabric of the buyer-seller dynamic into something collaborative and value-driven.

Give our Conversational Website a spin. It’s featured prominently on our homepage. Whether you're casually browsing or deep into evaluating data cataloging, governance, or DataOps solutions, we want to hear from you.

I can’t close without a massive shoutout to Bryon. His ability to translate a rough idea into a polished MVP in such a short time is nothing short of incredible. And kudos to the entire data.world team for their unwavering commitment to innovation. This isn’t just an incremental step forward; it’s a giant leap into a promising future for enterprise sales. And let me tell you, we’re just getting started.
