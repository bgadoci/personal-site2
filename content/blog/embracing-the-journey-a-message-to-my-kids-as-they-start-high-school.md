title: 'Embracing the Journey: A Message to My Kids as They Start High School'
---

The following is a text message I sent to my son and daughter the night before their sophmore and freshman year first day of school. I don’t share 99.9% of what I send them but for some reason this one felt like it might benefit others. So here it is…

I know waking up early for school isn’t something you’re excited about, and honestly, I can’t blame you. I remember being in your shoes—dreading those early mornings, the endless classes, the pressure of it all. High school can be tough, and it’s easy to focus on the challenges ahead. But let me tell you something: as much as I didn’t enjoy those days at the time, looking back, high school gave me some of the best memories and friendships of my life. Those years played a big part in shaping who I am today.

High school is a time of transformation, a stepping stone to the life you both want to live. It’s tough, yes, but it’s also great. This period is a crucial chapter in your story, where you’ll face obstacles, make memories, and discover who you want to become. It’s a time to embrace the journey, work through the tough moments, and take chances. I know it might be hard to see it now, but one day, you’ll look back and appreciate these times.

You’re both amazing kids, growing into incredible adults. It’s easy to get down when things don’t go as planned, but remember to lean in. Make the best of every situation, try hard, and don’t shy away from sacrificing now so you won’t have to later. When you feel low, renew your mindset, find another way, and keep pushing forward.

Part of me wishes I could fast forward time for you, to skip past the hard parts. But the other part of me knows that these experiences, even the tough ones, are what will make you stronger and wiser. As hard as it might be to believe, there will come a day when freshman and sophomore year are just distant memories. But the lessons you learn and the moments that stand out—those will stay with you forever.

This year, push yourselves to be uncommon. Don’t conform to what everyone else is doing. Strive to be better, to stand out. There will be moments, big and small, that you’ll remember for the rest of your lives. Some might be sad, some might be happy, but whatever they are, know that you’re built to handle them. Be present, but also keep an eye on who you want to become. Life is both long and short, and right now, you’re at the beginning of something amazing. You can be whoever you want to be—just believe in yourself.

As your dad, one of the hardest things is knowing that you can’t yet see the greatness that we see in you. But trust me when I say that you both have something special. Don’t let the system hold you back; beat it. That’s how winning is done.

I couldn’t be more proud to be your dad. Waking up might suck, but I hope this message gives you a spark of encouragement. You’re both on the right track. Don’t grow weary. Remember Roman’s 5:3-4: “We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.” These words have lasted for thousands of years for a reason. Believe in them, believe in yourself, and know that God has a plan for you. And always remember, Mom and I are here for you, no matter what.

I love you both more than you’ll ever know.
