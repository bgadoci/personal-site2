# Building Efficiency and Precision with AI: Introducing data.world’s Custom Demo Generator

# Building Efficiency and Precision with AI: Introducing data.world’s Custom Demo Generator

As the VP of AI Operations at data.world, I’m always focused on ways to leverage AI to make our employees more productive, empowered, and capable of delivering value to our clients faster. One recent innovation in this direction is a tool I developed called the Custom Demo Generator. This tool harnesses the power of AI to help our sales team create personalized demos for prospective customers in a fraction of the time it used to take.

#### The Challenge: Personalizing Client Demos

When potential clients see a demo, it’s essential that they experience something specifically tailored to their needs. Demos need to resonate with a prospect’s industry, products, and challenges. Traditionally, demos often used generic examples like “Acme Corp,” which doesn’t fully convey the value of data.world’s platform for the client’s unique needs. Creating personalized demos was a manual, time-intensive task, taking our sales engineers days or even longer—time they often don’t have given their busy schedules.

#### The Solution: Automating Demo Customization with AI

To solve this, I developed the Custom Demo Generator. Built with AI at its core, this application allows us to create a fully customized demo in minutes rather than days, enabling us to connect more meaningfully with potential clients while maximizing our team’s productivity.

#### How It Works: Step-by-Step Customization

The Custom Demo Generator guides users through a series of steps to create a tailored demo:

1. Identifying Industry Context: First, we enter the prospect’s name and company. The tool uses AI to determine the relevant industry, sub-industry, and tertiary industry. This sets the context for the entire demo, ensuring relevance from the very start. For example, for a prospect like “Michael Scott” at “Dunder Mifflin,” the tool accurately identifies “paper products” within “consumer goods and manufacturing.”

2. Choosing Concept Types: In data.world, we use concept types like business terms, metrics, geography, and regulations to organize information. These concept types allow us to present data in a way that’s familiar to the client’s business. In this step, I select the most relevant concept types for the demo—perhaps “business terms” and “geography” for a company like Dunder Mifflin.

3. Generating Items for Each Concept Type: After selecting the concept types, the tool generates a list of items that represent real-world entities within those categories. For example, under “business terms,” it might list specific supply chain terms, while under “geography,” it might include locations significant to the client’s industry. This item generation step enhances the demo’s specificity and relevance, reflecting the prospect’s operations and environment.

4. Creating Custom Descriptions: Next, the tool uses OpenAI to craft tailored summaries and descriptions for each item. This is where AI brings depth to the demo by contextualizing items in a way that’s unique to the client’s operations. For instance, the city of “Scranton, Pennsylvania,” might appear with details on its significance for Dunder Mifflin. These descriptions are editable directly within the tool, so I can make adjustments to ensure everything is just right.

5. Exporting as a TTL File: The final step generates a Turtle (TTL) file, a standardized data serialization format. This file can be quickly downloaded and uploaded directly into data.world, making the custom demo presentation-ready within minutes. This feature also enables last-minute adjustments, if needed, without disrupting the demo’s flow.

#### Unlocking Efficiencies and Enhancing Collaboration

With the Custom Demo Generator, what once took days now takes less than five minutes. Not only is this a time-saver, but it also becomes a collaborative asset: sales engineers can browse demos created by others, filter by industry, and quickly find something that aligns with a new prospect’s needs, saving them from having to recreate similar work from scratch.

#### Impact: A Smarter, Faster Way to Serve Our Clients

This tool is a game-changer for data.world. By automating the demo creation process and incorporating intelligent personalization, we’re delivering more meaningful interactions while freeing up our sales engineers to focus on higher-value tasks. It’s another example of data.world’s commitment to harnessing AI for real productivity gains, ultimately allowing us to bring value to our customers faster.

In less than five minutes, we can create a fully customized demo, tailored to each prospect and reflective of our dedication to excellence in AI operations.
