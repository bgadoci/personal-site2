title: 7 little things to do everyday to make things better
---

Most of the items we place in our todo lists are tactical and specific in nature. Because of this, we sometimes we lose our broader perspective. In order to ensure the minutia is aligned with our mission, here are some things to do every day.

#### 1. Plant Seeds

All of us have dreams and if we’re not careful, the daily grind can distract us from accomplishing the little things that propel us towards them. Every day we should take something out of our brain and get it into the wild. Send a tweet to someone you don’t think will respond. Apply for a job you don’t think you will get. Brainstorm an idea and share it with someone. Endorse someone influential on LinkedIn. Like planting a garden, sometimes you will be surprised at what pops up.

#### 2. Follow Up

Following up is a under appreciated skill. A simple, intentional check on someone or something can go a long way in developing relationships and ideas.

#### 3. Trash Something

The longer we alive the more stuff we accumulate. Whether it is bad bananas or bad ideas, trash something every day.

#### 4. Apologize

A true apology is liberates. We’re not perfect and often wish we could have said or done something a differently. Occasionally those incidents affect others in a negative way. When the occasion allows for it, apologize.

#### 5. Be Curious

Asking questions makes us more productive and strengthens relationships. Most people shy away from asking questions for fear of looking like a fool (thanks Mark Twain). The truth is the smartest people ask the most questions. Here is a template for asking more questions:

- Ask a question


- Ask a follow up question


- Summarize their answer and ask if you are correct



> Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. What people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity. — Aaron Swartz



#### 6. Watch a TED Talk

TED talks are short video presentations by the world’s most fascinating thinkers and doers. Topics include technology, design, business, global issues and many many more. These talks educate, challenge and enrich ones understanding of our experience.

#### 7. Look Up

With all we strive to accomplish it’s easy to get intoxicated with the unimportant. Remember to lift your gaze from the daily grind. We are only here a short time and realizing that helps us to keep things in perspective.

> Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.

– Psalm 90:20
