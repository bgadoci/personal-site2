This post outlines some of the exciting features we're planning to add to our Markdown + MongoDB content platform in the coming months.

## Feature Roadmap

### 1. Enhanced Search Capabilities

We're working on implementing advanced search features including:
- Full-text search with relevance scoring
- Search within specific categories or tag combinations
- Search history and saved searches

### 2. User Authentication

While the platform currently focuses on local content management, we're exploring options for:
- Simple authentication for content editors
- Role-based permissions
- Secure API access for headless CMS usage

### 3. Content Analytics

Understanding how your content performs is important, so we're building:
- Basic view tracking
- Engagement metrics
- Content performance dashboards

## Development Timeline

These features are still in the planning and early development stages. We expect to start rolling them out gradually over the next quarter.

Stay tuned for more updates!
