**Strengthening Bonds and Creating a Sense of Belonging**

As parents, we often strive to create special moments and memories for our children, especially on their birthdays. From parties to gifts, there are countless ways to make the day memorable. However, our family has a unique tradition that started spontaneously and has become something that everyone looks forward to.

The tradition is simple: the night before the birthday of one of our kids, the rest of us secretly decorate the living room with balloons and streamers after the birthday girl or boy goes to bed. It''s always a bit over-the-top, but it''s our way of reminding the kids how special they are first thing in the morning.

As my daughter turns 13, the tradition continues. With my son''s help, we blew up balloons until we about passed out. We even tried a new approach to hanging them on the wall called "Balloon Glue." It was fun and exciting, and we fully expect to find most of the balloons on the floor tomorrow.

What''s remarkable about this tradition is that it wasn''t planned; it just happened. Sometimes the best family experiences are the ones that come about spontaneously. Those are the ones that are truly unique to your family. 

Traditions are a way to create a sense of belonging that can''t be found anywhere else.
