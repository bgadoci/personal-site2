title: You can now posts notes on fitpholio

You know those thoughts you have immediately before or after doing a workout, taking a cold shower, or deciding whether or not to make time for a sauna or some sun? Or those thoughts that cross your mind mid-workout, regarding your strategy or the order of movements? Well, now you can capture those moments on Fitpholio.

Notes are pretty cool because they can function as a personal journal, offer tips to others, or simply provide insight into how you were feeling on a particular day. It's a great way to juxtapose your fitness journey with your thoughts. What's even better is that these notes can also serve as valuable tips for others.

Currently, when you add a note, it will appear in your timeline. However, in the near future, we're planning to introduce a separate section alongside Fitness Tests and Stats. This new section will allow you to review your thoughts over time and gain a deeper understanding of your fitness journey.
