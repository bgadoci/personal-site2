**From Back-Office Tools to Generative AI**

Though AI’s roots in the enterprise trace back as far as the 1950s with mainframes and early automation, over the past decade AI was still largely confined to back-office tasks—think payroll automation or inventory management. But fast-forward to November 30, 2022, and the release of ChatGPT marked a turning point. In just two months, 100 million users discovered the power of generative AI, making it the fastest-growing app of all time.

This sudden shift from back-office to front-office AI solutions has taken many organizations by surprise, highlighting a growing divide between AI experimentation and widespread operational integration.

Why does this matter for your business? While ChatGPT and similar tools demonstrate AI’s massive potential, there’s still a substantial gap between experimenting with these solutions and implementing them at scale.
